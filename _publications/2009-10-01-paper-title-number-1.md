In this paper, we address this issue and apply the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method to constant stress ADT. For illustration, stress relaxation ADT data are analyzed. We also make a simulation study to compare the s-credibility intervals for single model and BMA. The results show that degradation model uncertainty has significant effects on the p-quantile lifetime at the use conditions, especially for extreme quantiles. The BMA can well capture this uncertainty and compute compromise s-credibility intervals with the highest coverage probability at each quantile.
